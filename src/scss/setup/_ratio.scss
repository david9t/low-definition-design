/*
 * THE RATIO
 * This all-important number sets your base line-height.
 * But it also sets the multiplication factor for modular scale typography, layout sizing increments and pretty much everything else...
 * Try and derive the number from the ideal line-height for your base paragraph text.
 * Generally you'll want to chose a number between 1.4 and 1.6. Have a go with 1.618 if you really want to show off to your design friends.
 * Have a play, but anything lower than ~1.3 you'll start to lose distinction between your different heading levels. Anything higher than ~1.7 and your layout will scale too much.
